# 🏗️ LLD & Design Patterns — Java

A curated collection of **Low-Level Design (LLD)** examples and classic **Design Pattern** implementations in **Java**.  
The repo contains idiomatic implementations, short design notes, example usages, and small exercises to practice designing classes and interfaces for real-world problems.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn and implement common design patterns in Java (creational, structural, behavioral).
- Practice low-level design by modeling small systems (e.g., Parking Lot, Library, Elevator).
- Provide clear, testable examples that show when and how to use each pattern.
- Include short UML-like diagrams and reasoning where useful.
